## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## The Data
imdb movies has a tconst associated to a movie title of different genre premiered on different years with each movie voted and rated differently

## Methods/technologies used
* data mining
* data understanding
* data cleaning
* data visualization

### Results
* most movies sold are of sci-fi genre
* most movies created are of drama genre
* most rated moves are adventures

## Conclusions
From the data anaysed from the three data sets, its drawn that:

* sci-fi genres generated the highest gross amongst all the genres
* most movies are rated between 6 and 7
* most movies produced are of drama genre
* the trend of the gross earnde of the years has been dropping and rising
* there was no relationship between the number of votes of a certain genre with its rating
* adventures and documentary movies were highly rated
* war movies earned the lowest gross

## Recommendations

using the analyesd data, i would recommend the following
 * Microsoft should focus on creating sci-fi films- this is clearly shown by the fact that the films sold the
       most over the years, arguably if the trend continues, this would mean that microsoft will make some good gross
       over the years increasing their profits.This also has been driven by a fact that their main core value is utilize 
       technology which sci-fi does
       
 * Microsoft main mission is to empower pople to achieve and basing on this, i would recommend them to create more 
     of adventures, biography and documentary films to show case their mission accomplished. This will empower people 
     when microsoft films the most succesful stories and life story of the people that have made in different careers
     
 * Going with the current trend in the market, its seen that most movies created are of drama genre. I would recommend         Microsoft to create drama movies to keep up with the current market, they dont need to be obsolute, they are what they sell in the market now
